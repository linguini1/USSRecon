## How to play

<h3>Battles</h3>
Battles take place between two characters max.

<h4>Order</h4>
The character who is most quick-witted will attack first. This largely depends on the situation, but some characters
are typically more speedy than others. See "Characters" for a comprehensive list of attributes.

<h4>Format</h4>
Moves are displayed before each turn. When the character makes a move, the new health stats are displayed. 

<h3>Moves</h3>

<h4>Punch</h4>
Punching has unlimited use. It can be dodged, and all characters possess this move. Characters who use a firearm will
default to this attack when they run out of ammunition.

<h4>Dodge</h4>
This move sets up a character to dodge the next attack. With melee attacks, this completely avoids any damage. With
firearm attacks, this move can only dodge one bullet. This makes it ineffective against guns that have a rate of fire
higher than one shot per turn.

<h4>Use Item</h4>
This move is unique to the player. It allows you to choose an item to use during battle. Power-ups can be used to heal
in the middle of a fight, and ammunition can refill your gun. A player may use as many items as they like during one
turn. This move is incredibly useful and should be taken advantage of.

<h4>Attack</h4>
This move defaults to using the weapon a character has equipped. It will fire a gun, slash with a knife, or punch. For
NPCs, this move will default to punch if their primary weapon runs out of ammo. The player has a separate punch move
(in case they carry a melee weapon), so this move will just display **"out of ammo"** and prompt a new move choice
should they run out of ammo.
