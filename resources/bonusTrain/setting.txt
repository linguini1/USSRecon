NA: In transit to the Chelyabinsk Oblast, July 16, 1924
NA: 15:30
NA: ---
NA: You successfully purchased your ticket to Smolensk, which will be about a two hour long ride.
NA: While in the train station, you intercepted an Intelligence Agency contact and replenished your funds.
NA: Roubles burn quickly.
NA: You also made use of the payphone to deliver your mission status and new information to the Agency. This was done in code.
NA: ---
NA: The rhythmic chugging of the train along the track blends in with the clinking of dishes from the tables around you.
NA: Obviously, if the Agency is paying, you sit first class.
NA: The green and black striped booth seats line the walls of the cabin, with white tableclothed tables in between them.
NA: Each table faces directly onto a window, and is furnished with two place settings. The glasses are fine crystal.
NA: The waiter brings you a bowl of borscht and shot of vodka. As you relax in your seat, you notice something suspicious.
NA: At the table two booths in front of you, a spindly looking Russian is typing into a typewriter, with documents scattered around them.
NA: The document headers are written in English.
NA: ---
NA: You wait a while, watching the Russian go about their work. They finally gets up to use the washroom.
NA: You leave your now empty bowl of borscht at your table, and under the guise of stretching your legs, you walk past the documents.
NA: You didn't read much, but one of the documents has a "TOP SECRET stamp in the corner. That does not look good.
NA: It seems you're dealing with a Russian spy.
NA: Not a very well trained one to leave their documents at the table, but a spy nonetheless.
NA: You're going to have to get these documents back, which means luring the spy somewhere you can confront them.
